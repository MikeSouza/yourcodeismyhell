## "Redundant code at its worst." ##
I can't for the life of my fathom what my co-worker was thinking when this method was written:

{%gist 1195689 %}

The worst part is the TODO comment, which basically states to move this method to a static class called EnumUtil of a project/ assembly with common utilities... I guess the .NET framework not common enough!
