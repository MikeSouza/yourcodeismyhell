<p>_YouR_C0dE = "My Hell" or YCMH for short is a community site designed to make us all better developers/programmers/hackers. YCMH intends to be a repository of fun, insightful and hilarious code snippets with stories to tell. Think "TheDailyWTF" but with more collaboration.</p>

<p>How to submit a post:</p>

<p>Fork YCMH on <a href="https://github.com/steveturner/yourcodeismyhell">GitHub</a></p>
<p>Clone the repository:
<pre>git clone git@github.com:yourname/yourcodeismyhell.git</pre></p>
<p>Add a post to source/_posts using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or 
<a href ="http://textile.thresholdstate.com/">Textile</a> formatting.  Name it using the YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.markdown 
format. View the other posts for examples. </p>
<p>Upload the offending code to a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>. 
Embed the gist into your post using:<pre>{{  "{% gist gist_id [filename]"  }} %}</pre> omit [filename] for only one file.</p>
<p> Add the post to the git repository:
<pre>git add "your post filename here"</pre> </p>
<p>Commit your new post:
<pre>git commit -am "your commit message"</pre> </p>
<p>Push your commit to your repository on github:
<pre>git push</pre></p>
<p>Submit a pull request on GitHub from your forked repository.</p>

<h2>Legalese/Licensing</h2>

We want YCMH to be a community project. Posts are licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">CC BY-SA 2.5</a> That said, when submitting a "horror" story, please be considerate. Scrub names, and keep it light. Do not post proprietary code, make sure it is yours to legally distribute. We all want to be able to look at and edit the code... maybe even make it better!

If a submission is questionable, it will be pulled. YCMH is designed to be a site where you can even post your own programming faux pas, laugh, cry, and generally receive feedback.

If you have an issue with a submission, contact us. We'll be happy to yank it.
