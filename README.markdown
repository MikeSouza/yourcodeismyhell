## What is Your Code is My Hell?
1. **_YouR_C0dE = "My Hell" or YC = "MH" for short** is a community site designed to make us all better developers/programmers/hackers.
2. **YC = "MH" is powered by OctoPress**, which you can read about below.
3. **YC = "MH" intends to be a repository of fun, insightful, and hilarious code snippets** with stories to tell. Think [TheDailyWTF](http://thedailywtf.com/) but with more collaboration.
4. **To submit, create a gist on github and send it to us**. We'll pull it right into the repo.

## How to submit a post:

1.  **Fork** YC = "MH" on [GitHub](https://github.com/steveturner/yourcodeismyhell)
2.  **git clone** git@github.com:*yourname*/yourcodeismyhell.git
3.  Add a post to source/_posts using Markdown or Textile formatting.  View the other posts for examples.
4.  Upload the offending code to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)
5.  Embed the gist into your post using: {% gist gist_id [filename] %}, omitting [filename] if only one file.
6.  **git add** post_file
7.  **git commit -am "your commit message"
8.  **git push**
8.  Submit a pull request on GitHub


##Legalese/Licensing
We want YCMH to be a community project. Posts are licensed under the [CC BY-SA 2.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/)
That said, when submitting a "horror" story, please be considerate. Scrub names, and keep it light. Do not post proprietary code, make sure it is yours to legally distribute. We all want
to be able to look at and edit the code... maybe even make it better!

If a submission is questionable, it will be pulled. YCMH is designed to be a site where you can even post your own programming faux pas, laugh, cry,
and generally receive feedback.

If you have an issue with a submission, contact us. We'll be happy to yank it.

## What powers YCMH? Octopress!

Octopress is [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blogging at its finest.
